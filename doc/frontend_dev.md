# Frontend development

For frontend development, you need Node.js installed locally.   
Make sure you have `npm` and `express` installed. If not run:
```bash
npm init --y
npm install --save express
```

Spin up a node.js server locally with this command:
```bash
node app.js
```
This will start a server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) displaying the landing page.
